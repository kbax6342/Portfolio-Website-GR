I have gained experience from attending a Java development apprenticeship program through Grand Circus. After spending a year with General Electric as a front-end developer, I decided to take that experience with development and design and apply it to my career in becoming an Android developer. Some languages that I have gained a firm grasp on in my career are as follows: Adobe Suite, HTML(5), CSS(3), XHTML, JavaScript, JQuery, Angular JS, Node JS, Java, and SQL. With these tools, I have gained a strong footing in the web development field and plan on expanding my tools with each opportunity.</p>","About","","publish","closed","closed","","about","","","2020-09-21 01:40:42","2020-09-21 01:40:42","",0,"http://portfoliowebsite.local/?page_id=30",0,"page","",0),
